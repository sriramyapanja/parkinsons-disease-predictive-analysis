#The width of the violin plot at a given UPDRS value represents the density of individuals with that score in each group. The visual difference in distributions suggests that UPDRS scores could be a strong predictor of Parkinson's Disease.

#D. Pair Plots for Relationships Among Continuous Variables

```

#The diagonal displays the density distributions for each variable:
#Age: Both groups (red = Diagnosis 0, blue = Diagnosis 1) have similar distributions, with no major difference in density.
#BMI: Both groups show a comparable distribution, though slight differences exist in the central density.
#UPDRS: The group with Parkinson's Disease (blue) has a broader distribution and higher values compared to those without (red).
#MoCA: The group with Parkinson's Disease (blue) tends to have lower scores, indicated by a shift in the density toward lower values.

#2. Off-Diagonal Scatter Plots:
#The scatter plots reveal relationships between pairs of variables:
#Age vs. BMI: No clear trend is evident.
#Age vs. UPDRS: Weak or no relationship is observed.
#BMI vs. UPDRS: Minimal relationship; points are widely scattered.
#MoCA vs. UPDRS: A slight negative relationship may exist, especially for the Parkinson's group.

#Strong Predictors:
#UPDRS and MoCA seem more relevant to differentiating between the two groups, especially given their contrasting distributions and significant correlations.

#Weak Correlations:
#Variables like BMI and Age show weak relationships with other variables, suggesting they might not be strong predictors of diagnosis.


#UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS

#Based on the insights from the descriptive analysis-

#Continuous Variables:
#UPDRS: Strong difference observed in the violin plot. Higher values in Parkinson’s Disease group (Diagnosis = 1). Likely to have a significant association with Diagnosis.
#MoCA: Strong negative correlation with UPDRS for the Parkinson’s group. Lower scores in the Parkinson’s Disease group suggest cognitive impairment.
#Age: While the distributions are similar, age remains biologically significant for Parkinson's Disease.
#BMI: Weak correlation with other variables but still a clinically relevant factor.


#Categorical Variables:
#Gender: Differences in proportions of males and females across Diagnosis groups observed in the bar chart.
#Smoking: Majority are non-smokers, but a statistical test can validate any association.
#FamilyHistoryParkinsons: A clinically significant variable; test for association with diagnosis.
#TraumaticBrainInjury: Associated with neurodegenerative risks; test its relationship with Diagnosis.
#Hypertension: Common medical condition; useful to test for any connection to Parkinson’s.
#Rigidity and Tremor: Key symptoms of Parkinson's Disease; their prevalence should be highly associated with diagnosis.


#R Code for Normality Check- To determine whether to use a t-test or a Mann-Whitney U Test, we first need to assess the normality of each continuous variable

```{r}
# Continuous variables to test
continuous_vars <- c("UPDRS", "MoCA", "Age", "BMI")

  # Subset data by Diagnosis group
  group_0 <- data[data$Diagnosis == 0, var]
  group_1 <- data[data$Diagnosis == 1, var]
  
  # Shapiro-Wilk test
  shapiro_0 <- shapiro.test(group_0)
  shapiro_1 <- shapiro.test(group_1)
  
  # Print results

  cat("  Diagnosis = 1: W =", shapiro_1$statistic, ", p-value =", shapiro_1$p.value, "\n")
}

```

#None of the continuous variables (UPDRS, MoCA, Age, BMI) follow a normal distribution in either diagnosis group. Therefore, the Mann-Whitney U Test (a non-parametric alternative to the t-test) should be used for all these variables.

#Individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (Diagnosis = 1) tend to have higher and more varied UPDRS scores, consistent with the scale measuring Parkinson’s severity.
#Statistical Connection:The Mann-Whitney U Test for UPDRS showed a highly significant p-value, confirming that this observed difference in distributions is statistically significant.

#Individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (Diagnosis = 1) tend to have lower MoCA scores, which aligns with known cognitive impairments associated with the disease.
#Statistical Connection: The Mann-Whitney U Test for MoCA showed a highly significant p-value confirming that this observed difference in distributions is statistically significant.

#Individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (Diagnosis = 1) tend to be slightly older than those without the disease, although the age distributions for the two groups overlap considerably.
#Statistical Connection: The Mann-Whitney U Test for Age yielded a p-value of 0.0033, indicating a statistically significant difference in age distributions between the two groups. However, the difference is relatively small compared to variables like UPDRS and MoCA.

#Cognitive Functional:
#Highest AUC (~0.79) and Pseudo R² (~0.20), indicating that this cluster has the strongest predictive power for Diagnosis.

#Symptoms:
#Second-best performance, with an AUC of ~0.74 and a Pseudo R² of ~0.14. Still contributes significantly to the overall predictive model.

#Demographic, Lifestyle, Medical History, and Clinical Measurements:
#Lower AUC values (~0.53–0.55) and Pseudo R² values (close to 0). These clusters show weak predictive power individually.
